   AFISSIO — THE SHARED INTERIOR BEHAVIOUR SCRIPT
   ROUND-TOKEN: R32-CLEAN (2026-09-30) - no behaviour changed; four SELECTORS did. A distinction only this
   file cares about is a custom attribute now, never a class with no style (STRUCTURE.md 2b, 4a F4):
   section 2 reads data-field="centered" (was .hero-wave.is-centered), section 3 reads data-field="centered" /
   "plate" (was .is-centered / .is-plate) and SKIPS data-field="network", section 3b finds its host as
   .compute-field[data-field="network"] (was .network-field, a class identical to .compute-field), and
   section 1's settle list lost 20 lookups that matched no element on any page. Previous token below.
   ROUND-TOKEN: R30-BUTTON-PURPOSE (2026-09-22) - section 5 only: the accordion trigger is a Div
   Block with role="button" + tabindex="0" now, so this file owns Enter as well as Space. No other
   pass, selector, timing or failsafe changed. Previous token: R19-INSIGHTS (2026-09-18), below.
   ROUND-TOKEN: R19-INSIGHTS (2026-09-18)

   WAS pages/our-approach.js. Solutions' brief §3 and Insights' brief §3 both forbid a second and a
   third copy of a shared pass, so every behaviour an interior page can share lives here and every
   interior page links this ONE file. Our Approach's own file is deleted rather than left as a stale
   second copy; a page keeps a file of its own only for code no other page could use, and after
   this move no such code exists.

   ALL SIX PASSES BELOW ARE UNCHANGED from the R16/R17 file except for two mechanical edits, both
   named so the next reader does not have to diff:
     · the window guards are __afissioInterior… instead of __afissioApproach… (the two renamed
       passes are the settle and the field; the lattice, the accordion's sibling passes and the
       quote ember kept theirs, which were never page-named);
     · §2 takes querySelectorAll instead of querySelector, so a page carrying TWO headers — which
       is what an options page under review is — paints both fields instead of leaving the second
       a dead black box. With one canvas the behaviour is identical, which is what Our Approach
       must and does still get.
   Nothing else moved: same selectors, same timings, same easing, same failsafes, same reduced-motion
   returns, same beforeprint reveals. Our Approach behaves exactly as before.

   WHICH PASS SERVES WHICH PAGE. Every one is keyed to the ELEMENTS it serves and no-ops without
   them, so this file is safe on any interior page:
     1 settle          every interior page (class-keyed, never id-keyed)
     2 hero wave field every interior page header (.hero-wave — the canvas is CREATED, R27)
     3 compute lattice a statement band that asks for it (.compute-field, same) — Our Approach
     4 step focus      a numbered sequence (.step-plate) — Our Approach
     5 accordion       an FAQ list (.faq_row) — Our Approach
     6 quote ember     a testimonial panel (.quote_glyph) — Our Approach

   PREVIOUS HEADER, kept because everything it says is still true of the passes below:
   AFISSIO — OUR APPROACH · PRODUCTION BEHAVIOUR SCRIPT
   ROUND-TOKEN: R16-OUR-APPROACH (2026-09-17)

   FIVE behaviours are this page's own (R17 + its 2026-09-17 revisions): the settle list, the
   HERO WAVE FIELD behind the left-aligned page header, the COMPUTING LATTICE behind #judgment, and the
   per-step TILE ARRIVAL in #steps (section 4), plus the #questions ACCORDION (section 5). Everything else it needs is in
   pages/homepage.js, which is LINKED and never copied: the dropdown and sheet decorators, the
   hide-on-scroll bar and the rule sweeps. Its field behaviours and its own intro light pass find
   no elements here and no-op: this page rebuilds neither the document field nor `intro_art` - the
   header's watermark is `page-header_art`, and section 2 below drives it with its OWN guard, so
   the two passes can never both claim the same element. Its own settle is keyed
   to the homepage's eight ids
   (#intro #friction #anticipate #engage #method #proof #insights #contact) and this page uses
   none of them, so nothing is settled twice and the homepage's behaviour is untouched.

   #steps CARRIES NO ANIMATION, deliberately (BUILD-BRIEF §5 allows one and permits none):
   the settle below already stages the six steps in DOM order 130ms apart, so 1 → 6 arrives in
   order, once; a second engine narrating the same sequence is noise, and the lit marker is STATE,
   which must rest finished. See pages/our-approach/PHASE0.md §5.

   The contract, same as homepage.js: one IIFE with its own window.__afissio… guard · no globals ·
   no DOMContentLoaded (defer already runs after parse) · every behaviour no-ops when its elements
   are absent · runtime state inline only · reduced motion returns BEFORE anything is touched ·
   nothing rests at opacity:0 in any stylesheet, so a reader with JS off, a print or a crawler
   gets the finished page and the fade can only ADD to it · beforeprint reveals everything.
   ============================================================================ */

/* ============================================================================
   1 · THE SETTLE. Each section's blocks come up to full opacity over 1.6s, 130ms apart, and
   NOTHING MOVES — opacity is the only property that changes. Identical timing, easing, stagger
   and failsafes to homepage.js §11; only the selector list is this page's.

   R17: the sequence's host is `sequence_aside` now, not `sequence_head` - the sticky head, its
   description and its CTA settle as ONE block, and the six steps stagger past it afterwards.
   R35: #voice settles as ONE block too - `quote_panel`, the bracketed panel that replaced the
   centred `quote_stack` (portrait, mark, words and foot arrive together, as a panel should).

   The list is keyed on CLASSES, not ids: at review both option blocks of every section had to
   settle and only the A block carried an id, and after Phase D it stays that way so the next
   interior page inherits the list by wearing the families, not by adding its ids here. The page
   header is excluded — as the homepage's hero is —
   so the H1 and the lead are whole the moment the page paints; the footer is excluded because it
   is the page's ground, and ground does not arrive.

   Driven by RECT MATH on scroll, not IntersectionObserver, and with an interval floor: rAF is
   PAUSED and an observer reports nothing in a frame that is not being rendered, and both
   failures leave content blank. A rect is valid either way, and timers fire either way. And if the
   frame is hidden outright, the settle reveals the whole page at once rather than staging it into
   a transition that cannot advance.

   R19 adds four selectors, all for pages/insights.html: '.band_grid' (the statement band's

   CMS items stage in DOM order 130ms apart — which is how the series tells itself, and the whole

   2 · THE HERO WAVE FIELD (R19, four client notes 2026-09-17, plus a reference screenshot:
   "a dark hero with orange gradients as in the logo ... sort of wave animation, very smooth,
   very elegant, not distracting ... but of course I want a much darker version").

   WHAT IT PAINTS, back to front, on one rAF clock and nothing else:

     1 · GROUND   #000000, every frame. The page's own surface token, not a tinted near-black.

     0 · EVERY GRADIENT IN THIS FIELD IS SOFT-STOPPED (client note 2026-09-17: "i want the
                  gradient animation move like bubble, much smoother softer. now the gradient
                  starts too hard"). Three-stop gradients were leaving a steep core and a kink at
                  the middle stop. Every one of them - the four blooms, the sweep, the left veil
                  and the ground - is built from 9 to 13 stops on a smooth curve: a raised
                  cosine to the 2.1 across THIRTEEN stops for the blooms, which gives a narrower
                  bright core and a longer shoulder - darker and smoother at once, which is the
                  pair the client keeps asking for - eleven stops for the left veil, nine for the
                  sweep and the ground. No gradient in the hero has a kink in its slope anywhere.
     2 · BLOOMS   three radial gradients whose centres are INSIDE the lower-right quadrant, in the brand's TWO oranges and no third
                  colour - #FF6600 at 0.25 top right, #B34B00 at 0.17 low right, #FF6600
                  at 0.14 off the right edge, #B34B00 at 0.10 off the bottom right - taken down
                  again 2026-09-17 on "the gradient is too bright right now... make it darker,
                  smoother", from a pass that peaked at #A24100 - each on a TWO-HARMONIC path per axis and breathing its radius on a third
                  period again, so a bloom wanders a soft open line instead of retracing an
                  ellipse - it rises, sways past and comes back around, like a bubble. Taken down a
                  second step 2026-09-17 on the client's note ("make the hero animation
                  darker"): peak mixed value is about #220E00, down from #341500, and the field
                  is black by the lower third. Measured, not estimated.
     3 · (the rotating sweep was deleted at R27 - a full-screen linear gradient laid over the
                  blooms flattened the moving field into a wash, which is why it read as still.)

                  THE WAVES ARE GONE (client note 2026-09-17: "instead of waves move the
                  gradient smoothly that might be better"). Three sine silhouettes filled with
                  black used to roll over the glow; even unstroked, a filled shape has a
                  boundary, and a boundary is the thing the client kept objecting to - first as
                  crest lines, then as the shape itself. There is now no path, no fill and no
                  edge in the whole field: every pixel is a gradient sample, and the motion is
                  the gradient moving.

   Periods run 28-70s and every travel is a fraction of the section's own box, so the motion is
   legible when you look for it and never pulls the eye off the type. Slower than the waves were
   on purpose: a gradient carries motion at a scale a silhouette cannot, so it needs less speed.

   HOW IT SHIPS (§0, §4c-bis): a <canvas>, so it is custom code in the site's script bundle;
   @keyframes would not survive the style pipeline and a prefers-reduced-motion block is dropped
   by it, so REDUCED MOTION IS HONOURED HERE - one still frame, painted once, no loop. The canvas
   carries no information: with no script the hero is the black ground and the full type stack,
   which is all a reader, a crawler or a print needs. Nothing rests at opacity 0.

   pages"). The field's look is unchanged - same three blooms, radii, travel, periods, peaks, colours,
   same apex, same three veils. What changed is how it is drawn, and each change answers one symptom:
     · LAG. Every frame used to repaint SEVEN full-viewport fills (3 radial blooms, 3 veil gradients,
       the mark) into a 130vh store at 1.25x - ~4MP of gradient work a frame at 1920 - and rebuilt
       39 colour-stop strings to do it. Now the field is TWO canvases: the blooms, which are the only
       thing that moves, draw into a store at HALF the CSS size (capped 960px wide - a soft field has
       no detail to lose, and the browser's upscale is itself a blur); the apex and the three veils,
       which never move, draw ONCE into a full-resolution overlay and are only redrawn on resize.
       Stops are built once. Per frame: 3 fills on ~1/6 of the pixels.
     · CUTS. The loop read getBoundingClientRect() twice a frame - a forced style/layout flush right
       after the rule-drift loop had written its transforms. Size now comes from a ResizeObserver and
       on-screen from an IntersectionObserver: zero layout reads per frame.
     · DOES NOT CONTINUE. The clock was now - t0, and the watchdog reset t0 whenever frames were more
       than 900ms apart, so a busy moment made the field JUMP to another phase. The clock is now an
       accumulator advanced by each frame's delta, capped at 50ms: a stall slows it for an instant,
       it can never skip, and pausing off screen resumes exactly where it stopped. */

   3 · #judgment — THE COMPUTING LATTICE (client note 2026-09-17: "align center everything and in
   the bg of the section create computing dots etc darker orange on black... the center of the
   section will have no icons and animation but top bottom left right have dark orange computing
   animation with dots which represents AI and technology. be creative").

   WHAT IT PAINTS: a 20px lattice of 2px squares in #B34B00. Each dot's brightness is the
   INTERFERENCE of three travelling wavefronts - three sources, each on its own slow orbit, each
   emitting a sine in distance and time. Where their crests meet, a dot is bright; where they
   cancel, it drops to the floor. The result is bands of computation crossing the lattice and
   meeting, which is what a process looks like, rather than dots blinking at random - random is
   noise, interference is structure.

     v(dot) = sum over 3 sources of (1 + sin(dist * K - t * W)) / 2, normalised
     v(dot) = smoothstep(smoothstep(v))     <- R29c: pushes the mean out to 0 and 1
     alpha  = (FLOOR + v * (PEAK - FLOOR)) * hole(dot)

   THE CENTRE IS EMPTY. hole() is 0 inside 0.36 of the section's half-diagonal and rises on a
   smoothstep to 1 by 0.72, measured on an ELLIPTICAL metric so it matches a wide section rather
   than punching a circle in it. The type sits on plain black; the computation happens top,
   bottom, left and right of it - exactly the brief.

   DARK AND SOFT, both asked for - but RECOGNISABLE, which the client asked for twice (R29c, then
   R32 2026-09-17: "a little brighter, it is very difficult to recognize it now"). Peak dot alpha
   is 0.62 and the crest rides from #B34B00 up to #FF6600, which lands a bright dot at about
   #9E3F00 against a black ground; the floor stays 0.045, so the gaps still nearly leave and the
   bands are what gained. 2px dots on a 20px pitch cover 1% of the area - so the field reads as
   texture, never as a surface. No glow, no blur, no second hue: both oranges are hue 24-25
   degrees, so the crest is this one hue lifted in lightness, not a new colour.

   HOW IT SHIPS (§4c-bis): a <canvas>, so custom code in the site's script bundle. REDUCED MOTION
   PAINTS ONE STILL FRAME and stops. Nothing paints while #judgment is off screen or the tab is
   hidden, and the backing store is re-checked every frame so a section measured at 0 before
   layout settles heals itself. Nothing rests at opacity 0; no content is gated.

     · and the CONTRAST is the real fix. Averaging three sources pins v near 0.5 almost
       everywhere, which is why the field looked like a still grid: the dots were all the same
       brightness. Two smoothsteps on v push the mean out toward 0 and 1, so a band is genuinely

   3b · THE NETWORK FIELD — v3 (operator 2026-09-27: "so cluttered ... less lines, less dots, but
   more obvious, more stylish, more advanced ... the user must really feel it moving"). v2 meshed the
   whole band (~90 nodes, ~200 always-on hairlines, a wave through all of them every 2.4s), so no
   single thing in it could be seen. v3 is ONE OBJECT beside the type: a constellation of 22 nodes
   round one hub, built in 3D and turning in depth.
     · NODES: min-separation samples in an ellipsoid (deterministic). Depth is drawn — near nodes are
       5px, full orange, and resolve into hairline plates; far ones are 2px and dim.
     · EDGES, fixed in 3D so the structure turns as one: a spanning tree (no island) plus short
       second-neighbour links, ~30 hairlines; five dotted SPOKES join the hub to its inner nodes.
     · MOTION: one revolution per 32s, plus scroll (the page turns it, eased) and the pointer (it
       tilts toward the cursor). THE CALL: every 1.5s the hub sends a signal down a spoke and on for
       1–3 hops, a bright square head lighting each hairline; each node it reaches rings (a square
       outline expanding and fading), the last one — the expert engaged — rings larger.
     · Behind the type everything falls to ~15%, measured from the text itself.
   Same vocabulary: square dots, 1px hairlines, one hue ramped #B34B00 -> #FF6600. No glow, no blur.

   4 · #steps — ONE CURRENT STEP, AND ONLY ITS EDGE (client note 2026-09-17: "while scrolling up
   and down, only the current icon must change the color. not the bg color maybe only the
   borders. make it smoother").

   The previous build warmed every step it had passed and warmed its FACE as well as its edge,
   which turned six markers into a progress bar - a cumulative trail, not a current position.
   This is a single travelling focus instead:

     nearest  = the one plate whose centre is closest to the reading line
     w(nearest) = exp(-((plateCentre - readLine) / sigma)^2)   readLine = 52% of the viewport
     w(everyone else) = 0                                      sigma    = 7.5% of the viewport

   ONE BORDER CHANGES, EVER. A gaussian across all six left each neighbour at about 0.14, which
   is faint but still three borders visibly in motion at the same time; the nearest plate is now
   found first and is the only one that is ever warm. The tight sigma is what keeps the handover
   soft: by the midpoint between two plates the winner is already down to ~0.08, so the swap is
   a small step rather than a jump, and the inline 520ms transition covers it.

   w is a function of POSITION, so it runs backwards through the identical values on the way up.
   There is no state to reverse and nothing latches.

   w drives exactly two properties, both on the current plate:
     · the EDGE     #242424 -> #FF6600
     · the NUMERAL  #8E8E8E -> #FF6600
   The FACE IS NEVER TOUCHED (the client asked for borders, not backgrounds) and neither is the
   stem, which is structure. One lit hairline in a section of six is the section's only emphasis.

   HOW IT SHIPS (§4c-bis, §4f): inline from the scroll handler with a 16ms timestamp throttle -
   not a rAF, because rAF is paused in a frame that is not being rendered and a handler that only
   schedules one paints nothing there. A 520ms linear transition is written inline once at init so
   the colour glides between scroll samples. Reduced motion returns before anything is touched and
   the stylesheet's rest state stands: six finished plates, six grey numerals, the rail whole.
   Nothing rests at opacity 0 and no content is gated behind scrolling.

   5 · #questions — THE ACCORDION (client note 2026-09-17: "align center, create accordion for
   the faqs").

   PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT, not a reveal. All six panels are AUTHORED OPEN in the markup; this
   script collapses five of them on load and leaves the first open. That order matters: a
   collapsed-by-default accordion gates copy behind a script, and this project has been bitten
   three times by content that never arrived in a frame that was not being rendered. With JS off,
   printing, or in a crawler, #questions is six questions and six answers.

   HOW IT SHIPS: no keyframes and no runtime combo (sections 4c-bis, 4f) - the panel height and
   the mark rotation are written inline here, while the TRANSITIONS live in client-first.css on
   faq_panel and faq_mark-bar, which do deploy.

   R27-WEBFLOW-ELEMENTS: THE TRIGGER IS NOT A <button>. The old row was
   <h3 class="faq_q-wrap"><button><span class="faq_q"><span class="faq_mark"><span class="faq_mark-bar">
   - and the deployer builds NONE of that: a Heading cannot hold a Button, a Button holds no
   children at all, and every inline tag is transparent, so the question lost its class and BOTH
   drawn bars of the plus mark vanished outright. R27 rebuilt it as a Link Block,
   <a href="#" class="faq_trigger" role="button">, holding an <h3 class="faq_q"> and two classed <div>s.

   R30-BUTTON-PURPOSE (2026-09-22): THE TRIGGER IS A DIV BLOCK NOW -
   <div class="faq_trigger" role="button" tabindex="0">. The operator ruled how a button is built, BY
   PURPOSE: a control that NAVIGATES is the native Button (a link); a control that only TOGGLES
   something on the page - menu, accordion, tab, dialog - is a Div Block with role="button" and
   tabindex="0", its script handling Enter and Space; a SUBMIT is the Form Button inside w-form
   (reference/WEBFLOW-ELEMENTS.md section 1). An accordion toggle is not a link, so the href is gone
   and with it the preventDefault that held it. A <div> is focusable with tabindex but activates on
   NEITHER key, so this pass owns both now: the ONE keydown listener is EXTENDED with Enter rather
   than joined by a second listener, and preventDefault is kept for Space ALONE, where it is what
   stops the page scrolling under the reader. Nothing else moved - same class, same aria-expanded and
   aria-controls (section 4h), same setOpen, same one-open-at-a-time, the same :focus-visible ring
   authored in the sheet, and the same mouse behaviour: click fires on a div exactly as on a link.

   ONE OPEN AT A TIME: six answers this short are a set to scan, not a document to read in
   parallel, and a single open row keeps all six questions on one screen.

   6 · #voice — THE MARK IS AN EMBER (client note 2026-09-17: "animate the icon", on the display
   quote glyph the client kept at R36: "i like the quote icon etc").

   Two moving marks were rejected here before it: the raked bars that breathed to 1.14 on a 5.2s
   loop (R26) and the hairline with a segment travelling it (R32). Both moved a SHAPE. This moves
   only WARMTH, which is the motion vocabulary the hero field set for the page: the glyph's colour
   rides a 5.6s cosine from the stylesheet's #FF6600 up to #FFA347 - the hero's own ember tint, a
   lighter step of the same 24-27 degree hue, not a second colour - and back, and the glyph lifts
   3px with it. Nothing scales, nothing rotates, nothing travels.

   ADDITIVE, and it stops when nobody is looking: rest is the stylesheet's apex orange at rest
   position, the loop only ever lifts and lightens from there, and the rAF is skipped whenever
   #voice is off screen or the tab is hidden. With no script, reduced motion on, printing or in a
   crawler the mark is the finished glyph the stylesheet sets. Ships as custom code in the site's
   script bundle - @keyframes do not survive the style pipeline and prefers-reduced-motion is
   dropped by it (§4c-bis).

   7 · THE CONTENTS (2026-09-24; reading bar 2026-09-26, operator: "open and collapse ... super effective").
   The body is a CMS Rich Text element, so its <h2>s carry no id: this pass reads them, gives each an id
   and clones the ONE .toc_link template per heading. From 1280 the list is the sticky left rail; it
   scrolls inside itself on short screens and keeps the heading being read in view.
   BELOW 1280 the box becomes a READING BAR: sticky under the navbar (following it as it hides and
   returns), showing the section being read and n / N, with a 2px orange progress rule on its foot.
   The head is the toggle (role=button, Enter/Space); the list opens as an overlay capped to the screen
   and closes on a pick, Escape, or a tap outside. Picking jumps with the bar's height allowed for.
   STATE, NEVER CONTENT: with no script the list stands open in the flow. All state is INLINE (§4f).
   Reduced motion: no height animation, instant jumps. Nothing rests at opacity 0.

   9 · #process - THE HANDOVER, DRAWN (2026-09-27; one line since the operator's "merge them ... use gradient").
   It ADDS to a line that is already whole: CSS rests every .procedure_fill at full length, so with no script, or
   with reduced motion, the line simply stands. When the list first comes up the screen its fills are primed to
   zero and drawn on ONE clock from the first node to the arrow, and a token rides the leading edge; its colour
   follows the line - light through the grey, blending to orange across the gradient span, orange to the end.
   Each node pings (an outline that opens and fades) as the line reaches it. Afterwards, while the section is on
   screen, the token runs again every few seconds over the finished line; a pointer on a step pings its node.
   Geometry is read from the rendered parts at the start of every run, so the same code draws the horizontal line
   and the vertical one (<=991). State is inline (§4f); the token is created and removed here.
   Failsafes, as §1: rect polling with an interval floor, and a hidden frame, a resize mid-run or a stalled clock
   completes the line at once; print always gets it whole. Nothing rests at opacity 0.
